# Telegram Quote Bot

## Description

This is a simple telegram bot that can be used to send quotes to a telegram chat. The bot is written in Python and uses the `python-telegram-bot` library, which is a wrapper around the Telegram Bot API. It also uses a simple SQLite database to store the chat ID of the chat that the bot is forwarding messages to, in order to save your favorite quotes. Also it uses the [Ninja API](https://api-ninjas.com) to get random quotes.

To use the bot, search for `@RondomStuffBot` in the telegram app and start a chat with it.
Or you can use the following link to start a chat with the bot: [https://t.me/RondomStuffBot](https://t.me/RondomStuffBot)
